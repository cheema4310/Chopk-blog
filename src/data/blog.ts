**Control during intimacy.**

Not something you announce.

So I did what most men do: I stayed quiet… and tried to figure it out alone.

The real issue wasn’t just the problem itself — it was the confusion around it.

Back then, the internet was mostly noise:

- too many misleading “quick fixes”
- too many overhyped remedies
- too little real guidance

And pills? That never felt practical to me.  
They can build dependency and often stop working unless you keep increasing the dose.

Eventually, I stumbled on something different: **pelvic floor training (kegel exercises) for men.**

But I didn’t just follow random tips.  
Over time, I spoke with multiple urologists and started piecing together a simple, repeatable plan based on what kept coming up.

A method focused on:

- how to locate the right muscle
- what “correct engagement” actually feels like
- what to avoid (because doing it wrong can waste months)
- how to progress safely without overdoing it

Then I committed.  
Almost daily.  
Not perfectly — but consistently.

And slowly, things changed.  
What felt impossible (even lasting a couple of minutes) became manageable… then controllable… and eventually, I was comfortable for **30+ minutes**.

It wasn’t magic.  
**It was training.**

Fast forward to last year, I was explaining the method to a friend when it hit me:

**Most men fail because nobody teaches them a real process.**

A process that shows them how to:

1. Locate  
2. Engage  
3. Train  

the right muscle smartly, long enough to see results.

Without that guidance, most guys stay stuck in the same loop:

- confusion  
- inconsistent effort  
- wasted months doing it wrong  
- frustration that makes them quit  
- or dependency on short-term fixes

That’s when **ChopK** clicked.

ChopK is the version I wish existed in my late teens and early 20s…`
